      <h1>Scorecard and Pilot Feedback</h1>
      <p>
        Groundbreaking New Wildfire Resilience Scorecard Empowers Communities to Assess Wildfire Risk, Boost Preparedness<br>
        Global Rollout Kicks Off With Pilot Program to Test Methodology. Participants Wanted <br>
        X, X, 2023, (San Francisco, CA) --- Communities worldwide now have an invaluable new tool to thoroughly evaluate
         wildfire vulnerability and strategically strengthen resilience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The groundbreaking ARISE-US/CrowdDoing Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention & Consortium (CWP&C) Community Wildfire 
        Resilience Scorecard enables a comprehensive assessment of wildfire risk across property, community and landscape 
        scales. Developed collaboratively and peer-reviewed by wildfire experts in ARISE-US and CrowdDoing CWP&C, the 
        scorecard provides a robust set of questions to develop a baseline assessment, identify risks, and contribute 
        to creating targeted preparedness plans, and driving unified action.

        Community Wildfire Resilience Scorecard, published on the United Nations’ Disaster Risk & Resilience (UNDRR), 
        Prevention Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ARISE-US/CrowdDoing CWP&C Community Wildfire Resilience Scorecard framework incorporates cutting-edge 
        resilience principles and a diverse range of readiness factors. These include land use planning, infrastructure 
        hardening, public education, governance, nature-based solutions, ecosystem management, and post-disaster 
        recovery capacity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The scorecard prepares a community to develop a prioritized action plan to substantially reduce wildfire risks 
        through integrated planning, mitigation and governance. This tool has immense potential to galvanize stakeholders 
        across public, private and civic spheres. Together, we can build collaborative resilience and catastrophic 
        wildfire risk reduction strategies worldwide against increasingly devastating wildfires.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global rollout kicks off with a pilot program enabling municipalities worldwide to test and refine the Wildfire Resilience Scorecard. <br>

        "By building systems change strategies in collaboration with diverse global virtual collaborators we can become 
        more effective at catastrophic wildfire risk reduction. Through this approach, we can empower communities to 
        take strategic action to reduce wildfire risks and build pathways of prevention based on understanding their 
        risks and capabilities through use of this scorecard. Together, we can create more resilient communities ready 
        to thrive in our hotter, drier, more fire-prone world," said Bobby Fishkin, Co- CEO CrowdDoing CWP&C.<br>
        This is only the beginning for The ARISE-US/CrowdDoing CWP&C Community Wildfire Resilience Scorecard 
        collaborative development. <br>
        The ARISE-US/CrowdDoing Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention & Consortium team invites a wide variety of stakeholders, 
        including the public and private sector, to adopt this scorecard, pilot their own deeper understanding of their
         risk and resilience, and to consider helping us to improve the scorecard with feedback, pilots and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to local communities, example stakeholders include: 
        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
          <li>Local, regional, and national governments</li>
          <li>Insurance companies</li>
          <li>Reinsurance companies/ Insurance linked security companies</li>
          <li>Utility companies</li>
          <li>Social enterprises</li>
          <li>Neighborhood and home-owner associations</li>
          <li>Developers/real estate/ landowners</li>
          <li>Community wildfire organizations</li>
          <li>Local community emergency preparedness associations etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        All communities are expected to have gaps in catastrophic wildfire community risk reduction. The objective is 
        to anticipate how vulnerabilities to wildfire generate opportunities for catastrophe community risk reduction
         and a chance to learn from others who have already embraced some of these strategies. We aspire to amplify 
         network effects in the form of accelerated learning from many regions creatively reducing their risks and 
         sharing their results in a community of practice. <br>
         The ARISE-US/CrowdDoing CWP&C Community Wildfire Resilience Scorecard has been released as an open source tool.
